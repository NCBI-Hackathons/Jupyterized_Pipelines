NGS provides an unpredecented level of resolution, allowing researchers to ask previously unanswerable questions such as how cancer pathogenesis might be mediated by very small changes in gene expression.*\n","\n","*With ~3 million records currently stored in the SRA database, and submissions growing exponentially, the SRA collection represents a treasure -trove of data to be mined by academia and industry. The information contained in a single SRA dataset is equivalent to hundreds of in vitro experiments worth of work, potentially saving thousands of dollars and research hours*\n","\n","*Here we present viSRA, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq data from SRA datasets on the fly. There are a variety of tools to analyze and visualize microarray data, and these can be leveraged to accelerate developement of feature rich RNA-Seq tools. viSRA facilitates the interrogation of SRA datasets for differential gene expression via dockerized pipeline. viSRA makes it easy for biologists to perform pathway enrichment analyses and to interrogate which genes are differently expressed between experiments. viSRA benefits greatly from previous work on deSRA and the MicroArrayPipeline.*\n","\n","## What's the Problem?\n","---\n","\n","*The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) provides NGS data along with sample and project metadata (NCBI Resource Coordinators 2017). As part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, the SRA supports access to data from a wide variety of experimental types and sequencing instruments. Unfortunately, it can be time-consuming and difficult to access and analyze the data, especialy if you want to quickly develop meaningful hypotheses. viSRA bridges this gap between advanced bioinformatic data and users.*\n","\n","## Why Should We Solve It?\n","---\n","\n","*The amount of NGS data stored in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data-base is growing rapidly. However, many researchers who are interested in this data do not have experience with the tools necessary to analyze it effectively. viSRA increases the utility and return on investment of NGS projects by making the data more accessible to a wider range of individuals. \n","\n","# What is viSRAtoo?\n","---\n","\n","viSRA is a tool to compare two sets of NGS data for differences in gene expression. For example, if the user is interested in how gene expression varies in the liver after treatment for HCV, they may be interested in looking at a BioProject record that links the runs for a relevant experiment, such as [BioProject Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/328986) From that page, you can select the link for SRA experiments, then view the results in SRA Run Selector, which displays a table including the SRA run accessions and treatment conditions, [BioProject Data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=328986). You will also need a list of up to 10 gene names to use for viewing and outputting plots and graphs. \n","\n","viSRAtoo runs on R Shiny, which calls the command line tools below for upstream processing. The resulting tables and graphs are displayed on the web-based Shiny GUI. \n","\n","## Processing RNA-seq Data\n","---\n","\n","The first step is to build a blast database for your reference genome using MagicBLAST, MagicBLAST produces a SAM file, which is processed by separate scripts encoding SAMtools commands. The SAM file is converted to a BAM file, which is then sorted and indexed. A quality control is generated by running FASTQC on the BAM file. The Subread tool featureCounts is then used to produce gene counts, which are then normalized with TMM and converted to gene expression in R with the packages limma and edgeR. The resulting normalized gene expression, dot plots, violin plots, heatmap, and FASTQC report are displayed on the GUI. \n","\n","# How to Use viSRAtoo?\n","---\n","\n","The misRA.R script works by taking in 3 arguments (2 SRR numbers for mouse RNA-seq data and 1 list of genes), processes the files and output gene dot plots into the working directory. The shiny scripts (server.R ui.R) are still in development. \n","\n","## Installation Options: \n","---\n","\n","We provide two options for installing **Docker** or directly from **Github**. \n","\n","## Docker\n","\n","The Docker image contains as well as a webserver and FTP server in case you want to deploy the FTP server. It does also contain a web server for testing the main website (but should only be used for debugging purposes).\n","\n","Use this command to pull the image from the DockerHub:\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"Fuqy0gWSKNES","colab_type":"code","colab":{"autoexec":{"startup":false,"wait_interval":0}}},"cell_type":"code","source":["!docker pull ncbihackathons/<this software>"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"twhwyPjaKVT9","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Use this command to run the Docker image from the master shell script.
