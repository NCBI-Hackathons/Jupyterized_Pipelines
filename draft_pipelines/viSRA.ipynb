NGS provides an unpredecented level of resolution, allowing researchers to ask previously unanswerable questions such as how cance pathogenesis might be mediated by very small changes in gene expression. \n","\n","WIth ~3 million records currently stored in the SRA database, and submissions growing exponentially, the SRA collection represents a treasure-trove of data to be mined by academia and industry. The information contained in a single SRA dataset is equivalent to hundreds of in vitro experiments worth of work, potentially saving thousands of dollars and research hours. \n","\n","Here we present viSRA, a tool for visualizing RNA-seq data from SRA datasets on the fly. There are a variety of tools to analyze and visualize microaarray, and these can be leveraged to accelerate development of feature rich RNA-Seq tool. viSRA facilitates the interrogation of SRA datasets for differential gene expression via dockerized pipeline. viSRA makes it easy biologist to perform pathway enrichment analyses and to interrogate which genes are differentially expressed between experiments. viSRA benefits greatly from previous work on deSRA and the MicroArrayPipeline. \n","\n","## What's the Problem\n","---\n","\n","The NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) provides NGS data along with sample and project metadata (NCBI Resource Coordinators 2017). As part of the International Nucleotidde Sequence Database Collaboration, the SRA supports access to data from a wide variety of experimental types and sequencing instruments. Unfortunately, it can be time-consuming and difficult to access and analyze the data, especially if you want to quickly develop meaningful hypothesis. viSRA bridges this gap between advanced bioinformatic data and users. \n","\n","## Why should we solve it?\n","---\n","\n","The amount of NGS data stored in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data-base is growing rapidly. However, many researchers who are interested in this data do not have experience with the tools necessary to analyze it effectively. viSRA increases the utility and return on investment on NGS projects by making the data more accessible to a wider range of individuals. \n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"ZG7OZKt73C21","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# What is viSRA?\n","---\n","\n","viSRA is a tool to compare two sets of NGS data for differences in gene expression. For example, if the user is interested in how gene expression varies in the liver after treatment for HCV, they may be interested in looking at a BioProject record that links the runs for a relevant experiment, such as [Data Sample]( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/328986). From that page, you can select the link for SRA experiments, then view the results in SRA Run Selector, which displays a table including the SRA run accessions and treatment conditions, [Data Sample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?linkname=bioproject_sra_all&from_uid=328986) You will also need at least one Entrez Gene name to search against the SRA datasets.\n","\n","## Build BLAST database\n","---\n","\n","The first step to running the tool is to build BLAST databases for each of the input genes. Building the databases this way allows for  rapid querying of only those databases that are relevant to your query, and allows for parallelization, thus increasing the programs speed. The accession, start & stop positions, and gene ID are pulled from `ref_GRCh38.p7_top_level.gff3`. Based on those positions, a bash script retrieves the sequences in FASTA format and saves each as an individual BLAST database in the active Docker server.
