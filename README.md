# Jupyterized_Pipelines

Devante Thompson's big bag of awesome pipelines. All Jupyter notebooks are stored here and are available on Google Colaboratory (see links below).

### Google Colaboratory Notebook Links

- [`magicblast`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sKElWdobLyK2DpQnpconqtk4TbjFqVCA)
  - **Note:** [magicblast.ipynb notebook in this GitHub repo](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Jupyterized_Pipelines/blob/master/magicblast.ipynb) was exported from Google Colaboratory. You will need to remove all `!` before commands if running locally with `jupyter notebook`.

### Jupyter Notebooks

- `fusera_vc` directory contains a Jupyter notebook that uses [Fusera](https://github.com/mitre/fusera) to access data stored in the cloud and [bcbio](https://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) pipelines to do variant calling.
